8-Puzzle Solver Using Hill Climbing (Displaced Tile Heuristic)

This project implements the 8-Puzzle problem using a Hill Climbing search algorithm with the Displaced Tile Count as the heuristic function.
Hill Climbing selects the best next move based on the heuristic, aiming to reach the goal configuration by continuously improving the puzzle state.

However, since Hill Climbing can become trapped in local maxima, the program detects these situations and prints the path taken before termination.

hill_climb(start):
    visited ← {start}
    current ← start

    while True:
        if current is goal:
            print path; exit

        successors ← all valid moves of current
        choose child with lowest heuristic

        if no child improves heuristic:
            print "local maxima"; print path; exit
        else:
            current ← best child
